# GoogleSearchPage
# I have created a simple framework based in POM aligned with TestNG using Selenium Java to support google search page tests.
# The class GoogleSearchPageTest under src test have the actual test methods. 
# Base is a package which has all the generic methods in it. 
# Extent_Automation_Report has the report about the tests that are ran. 
# Failed test cases are captured as a Screenshot and it will be stored under the folder called "Screenshots"
# I smilpy added the priorty, I checked it will be exceuted correctly even if we changed the priority. 
# Under data folder I have added an excel sheet which help this framework to feed the inputs for test. 
# Based on my skills i have created this and let me know if you feel this could be optimized further. Good to hear from you!
